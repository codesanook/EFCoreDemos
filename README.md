# Entity Framework Core Demos

Here we keep the source code for some demos we ususually use for conference talks about EF Core like
- [What's New in Entity Framework Core 2.0, .NET Conf 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pUVC3trvHc)
- [Entity Framework Core 2.1: Simple, Powerful Data Access for .NET, Build 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k55kDH_ixrQ) 
- [Novedades en Entity Framework 2.1 y acceso a datos con .NET, DotNet 2018, Madrid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6j5lGCQ688)

The compiled query demo requires the AdventureWorks database installed on an instance of SQL Server.
All the other demos are self-contained.

The location of these demos may change in the future. Save a bookmart to https://aka.ms/efcoredemos which should be updated.
